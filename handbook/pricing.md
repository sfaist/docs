We offer multiple pricing tiers depending on the number of products processed, support requirements, and features. We do not charge for queries on your catalog or affiliate purchases through your network accounts. Please contact us for specific pricing details.

## Managing billing

All instances communicate with a central **Billing Service**. The Billing Service manages product information, plans, and feature entitlements. Our payment provider Stripe handles customer information, invoices, and payments. The billing service synchronizes with Stripe to ensure all information is accurate before responding to customer requests.
