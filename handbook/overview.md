Our primary focus is on making our customers successful with our product, making sure they are happy with index and its performance.

The Sales team act as genuine partners with our users. We should feel as motivated to help and delight users as if we were on their team. In practical terms, this means:

- No sales-y talk - we are direct, open and honest with customers. We share as much as possible publicly, rather than hiding it behind a mandatory demo call. We are honest when we don't know the answer, or if we're not sure that index is the right solution for a customer.

- Speed - we are frighteningly responsive. If a customer is in a rush, we do our best to work at their pace. We are clear about expectations, and do not promise what we cannot deliver to close a deal. 

- Engineers helping engineers - there is nothing more frustrating than talking to a salesperson who can't give you all the answers. We keep 'let me find out from the team' to an absolute minimum.

- We leverage our own engineering team to help users set up their infrastructure with index. This is an integral part of our deployment strategy, and we are very good at getting people up and running quickly.

- We don't do margin negative deals in order to win - this doesn't set us up for a successful long term relationship with a paying customer if we're ultimately losing money to land them. Yes, this includes fancy companies whose logos would make us look good. 


## Sales vision 

### Things we want to be great at

- **Genuinely helpful:** We deliver genuinely useful insights about things our customers care about in the sales process and beyond.

- **Speed:** We want to be highly reactive, low process, and reliant on other teams as little as possible to ship things. We want to get stuff wrong quickly, then iterate. 

- **Community:** We realize that we are at the forefront of a new generation of innovative products for commerce, and we want to provide a community experience for all of our users. This means that we need to provide the platforms for our users to connect and build with each outer, rather than in their own silos.

## Big things we care about in 2024

- Continue to build index with our initial set of pilot customers. Make them succeed in their ventures, and keep them happy.

## Target customers

We have defined our ICP as anyone who:
- Innovates or plans to innovate in the commerce space
- Need to excel at product-led growth to remain competitive
- Has a budget, and savvy engineers to implement the product
- Has achieved some level of product-market fit
- Operating in USA, UK, or EU, see [who we do business with](/handbook/who-we-do-business-with)

This does not mean that we will only be talking to people who do not fit these criteria if they have a similar need or will grow into an ICP soon.
