## What is index?

index is the data layer for commerce applications, designed to make any marketplace, media platform, or app shoppable by providing robust product data and order APIs. Our moat is that we provide access to virtually all merchants' listing information in seconds, not months.

- **Next\-gen partner onboarding**: We provide UIs for your partners to upload their data in any format, and we handle the rest.
- **Advanced product understanding**: Automated matching and grouping of duplicate products from different sources, semantic search ('winter outfits') and reverse image search ('shop what you see') for products across your catalog and the web.
- **Native checkout support [WIP]**: Connect to your merchant's stores and earn \$\$\$ by selling any product instantly.


## How index works

The index Product Data Engine is a B2B database & search engine for commerce. index ingests data from web sources, product feeds, and custom files in any format. 
Using our custom trained AI, index then:

1. Automatically understands the structure of the data
2. Transforms data into the desired target structure
3. Analyzes and hosts the processed data in your personal product catalog for easy access and querying
