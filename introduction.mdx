## What is index?

index is the data layer for commerce applications, designed to make any marketplace, media platform, or app shoppable by providing robust product data and order APIs. Our moat is that we provide access to virtually all merchants' listing information in seconds, not months.


## How index works

The index Product Data Engine is a B2B database & search engine for commerce. index ingests data from web sources, product feeds, and custom files in any format. 
Using our custom trained AI, index then:

1. Automatically understands the structure of the data
2. Transforms data into the desired target structure
3. Analyzes and hosts the processed data in your personal product catalog for easy access and querying
