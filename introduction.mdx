## Key Features

- **Automated Data Processing**: Index automatically creates detailed mapping rulesets from various sources.
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Reacts to changing or new data structures in real-time.
- **Scalable Performance**: Reliably processes billions of rows without AI scalability concerns.
- **Constant Data Refresh**: Product data is continuously updated and hosted for instant access.

## How index Works

The index Product Data Engine functions similarly to a specialized search engine for commerce. It ingests data from:

- Web sources
- Product feeds
- Product databases

Using advanced AI, index then:

1. Creates a detailed mapping ruleset
2. Transforms data into the desired target structure
3. Hosts the processed data for easy access
